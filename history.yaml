# History of the world.

***IMPORTANT:*** **Many details of this history are lost to time and not known by most people in the world. This serves mostly to further the understanding of the setting.**

## Dawn of Civilization (5000 years ago)

Civilization started to form for the first time about 5000 years ago when the old gods arrived on the world of Ixios. They came with the gifts of knowledge,
and culture, blessing the fledgling humanoid races of the world with the necessary tools to overcome the beasts and the elements that reigned supreme during this time.

**In this world, dinosaurs never really died out, they were just subjugated by civilization. So you can certainly imagine early civilization to be a lot like
Monster Hunter**

Humanoids banded together for the first time in the history of Ixios. Bands became tribes and tribes became towns, settlements, cities and eventually, kingdoms.
The humanoids of this time where very aware of the fact, that they had the gods to thank for the status they had gained. And in turn, they worshipped the gods.

## Height of Civilization and Fall of the Gods (2000 years ago)

As the humanoid races developed further and further, they obtained great understanding of technology and magic alike. At the height of civilization, the mainland
was divided into two super-kingdoms: The magic-focused Arcania and the technology focused Mechanos. The two kingdoms got along fairly well, despite their differences
in how they approached the world. Both kingdoms had colonies across the entire planet and some even rumour that their reach extended both beyond the planet and the 
Material Plane. Society at this point in time was almost a post-scarcity society. Hard labour and poverty were practically unheard of on the mainland and even simple
people enjoyed substantial luxuries.

And the gods? They were nearly forgotten. The old gods had an agreement that they would never directly interfere with the humanoid races. Only ever working 
through inspirations, blessings and prophets. As the hardships disappeared and the humanoid races obtained greater and greater understanding of the world, the need for
the gods disappeared.

This split the gods into three groups. One group decided to simply leave the world behind, looking for another planet in the universe in the need of protectors.
The other two groups decided to stay, yet their opinions differed wildly on how to proceed. One group wanted to simply stay and observe, marvel at the fact that this
world was as perfect as a world mostly shaped by mortals could ever be. The other group wanted to be worshipped again, no matter the costs. And so the latter
started to directly influence morally weaker individuals of the world. First, cults sprang up and second a chain of devastating catastrophes would be set in motion
that would destroy most of humanoid society forever.

The observing group of gods reacted too late. They attempted to stop their brethren but failed. Almost all of them were slaughtered or consumed. Only Alviana, goddess
of dreams managed to escape into the astral realm in a search for help while the now newly-labeled Arch-Fiends continued to wreak havoc on the world.

## The Plagues (2000 years ago - 500 years ago)

As if the sudden surge in dark cults from necromancy to blood magic to warmongers and beast riders wasn't enough, the war between the old gods and the arch-fiends
caused multiple so-called plagues across the world of Ixios which ultimately sealed the fate of humanoid civilization as it was known at that point in time.

Some of the major events were 
* the total and complete collapse of technological systems
* the arcane plague which killed almost every magic user and drove the rest of them utterly mad
* the elven madness which turned the ascended elves into feral beasts and only their less evolved kin managed to retain their wits
* the orcish rage, which was not as bad as the elven madness but it did turn the noble seafaring orcs into aggressive warriors that hate all other races but their own
* the draconic massacre which saw the metallic dragon go almost extinct and led to a rise of the chromatic dragons which subsequently conquered and enslaved the orient
* the spontaneous necromancy which caused the dead in the western parts of Arcania to rise as undead without the use of necromantic magic

All of this combined lead to much of the mainland fall into utter darkness with only few areas clinging on to civilization, now without access to technology or magic
and up against supernatural threats and cults wielding dark divine magic that was unlike anything the people of the world had ever seen before.

## The Rise of the New Gods (500 years ago - now)

A new hope would arrive 500 years ago. Alviana found new allies, a pantheon of young gods, still looking for their own destiny who accepted the challenge of saving
the doomed world of Ixios. Their arrival came not with a bang but in the form of a calm, some of the worst plagues started subsiding as the new pantheon took the reign
of some of the world's aspects again, through sheer numbers achieving somewhat of an equilibrium with the arch fiends. They also allowed themselves, unlike their
predecessors, to take direct action in the world, granting knowledge but also power to promising mortals, equipping them with never before seen divine magic.

**This was the first time that clerics/paladins existed in this setting.**

With the calming of the arcane plague, it slowly became possible again to utilize magic again, however, capable magic users still remain exceedingly sparse across
the lands.
