# Classes

## Martial Classes (Fighters, Rogues, Barbarians, Monks)

Martial classes don't have any special restrictions or properties in the setting of Ixios. Ki is a concept that was actually brought by the New Gods into the world
however it is now part of the world and doesn't have to be granted newly on a per person basis, rather it can simply be learned to be used.

## Arcane Classes (Wizards, Sorcerers, Eldritch Knights, Arcane Tricksters, Bards)

After the Arcane plague wiped out any and everyone who wielded magic (both actively and passively through items or enchantments), the understanding of magic was
practically lost. Many people don't believe in arcane magic anymore and those who do view it with extreme suspicion.

Arcane magic is generally practiced mostly in secret circles and remote locations and not something anybody would wield or teach lightly out in the open.

Sorcerers, the only arcane class who is born with magical talents instead of purely learned, may even elect to surpress their gifts to avoid being cast out from society.

## Spiritual Classes (Druids, Rangers)

Spiritual magic used to be a closely guarded secret by the elves and orcs during the height of civilization.

Only after the collapse did those secrets slowly get out and become adopted by others. It was the only form of magic that remained untainted by the arcane plague.

While still practiced in secrecy, nature witches and spiritual healers are treated with a mixture of respect and fear by the common folk.

## Divine Classes (Paladins, Clerics)

Divine magic is granted by the new Pantheon (as described in the history file). It fills anybody observing it either with awe or with dread, depending on the alignment
of the being granting the power. As with spiritual magic, people might be more accepting towards good aligned divine magic, but still treat it with a mixture of fear
and respect.

The New Gods are many and some are still freshly arriving. As such, when creating a divine character you can define the god as well as their relationship with your
character for yourself.

## Warlocks

Warlocks count as Spiritual, Divine or Arcane casters, depending on their patron. The nature of a specific patron should be discussed on a case by case basis.
We use the patrons in the book as templates for beings you want to come up with, similar to the gods for divine characters.
